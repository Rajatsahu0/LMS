            <p class="features-text text-black">ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for
               building reusable UI components. It is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only
               for the view layer of the application. It was created by Jordan Walke, who was a software engineer at
               Facebook. It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and was later used in its products like
               WhatsApp & Instagram. Facebook developed ReactJS in 2011 in its newsfeed section, but it was released to
               the public in the month of May 2013.

                  <p class="text-justify">As its official tagline states, <a href="https://reactjs.org/"
                        class="external" rel=" noopener">React</a> is a library for building user interfaces. React is
                     not a framework – it's
                     not even exclusive to the web. It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments.
                     For
                     instance, <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" class="external" rel=" noopener">React Native</a> can
                     be
                     used to build mobile applications.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with <a
                        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html" class="external" rel=" noopener">ReactDOM</a>.
                     React
                     and ReactDOM are often discussed in the same spaces as — and utilized to solve the same problems as
                     —
                     other true web development frameworks. When we refer to React as a "framework", we're working with
                     that colloquial understanding.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">React's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are
                     building UIs. It does
                     this through the use of components — self-contained, logical pieces of code that describe a portion
                     of
                     the user interface. These components can be composed together to create a full UI, and React
                     abstracts
                     away much of the rendering work, leaving you to concentrate on the UI design.</p>

                  <p>
                  <h3>Use cases</h3>
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-justify">Unlike the other frameworks covered in this module, React does not enforce
                     strict rules around code
                     conventions or file organization. This allows teams to set conventions that work best for them, and
                     to
                     adopt React in any way they would like to. React can handle a single button, a few pieces of an
                     interface, or an app's entire user interface.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">While React <em>can</em> be used for <a
                        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html" class="external"
                        rel=" noopener">small pieces of an interface</a>, it's not as easy to "drop into"
                     an application as a library like jQuery, or even a framework like Vue — it is more approachable
                     when
                     you build your entire app with React.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">In addition, many of the developer-experience benefits of a React app, such as
                     writing interfaces
                     with JSX, require a compilation process. Adding a compiler like Babel to a website makes the code
                     on
                     it run slowly, so developers often set up such tooling with a build step. React arguably has a
                     heavy
                     tooling requirement, but it can be learned.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">This article is going to focus on the use case of using React to render the
                     entire user interface of
                     an application, using tooling provided by Facebook's own <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/"
                        class="external" rel=" noopener">create-react-app</a> tool.</p>

                  <p>
                  <h3>How does React use JavaScript?</h3>
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">React utilizes features of modern JavaScript for many of its patterns. Its
                     biggest departure from
                     JavaScript comes with the use of <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html"
                        class="external" rel=" noopener">JSX</a> syntax. JSX extends JavaScript's syntax so that
                     HTML-like
                     code can live alongside it. For example:
                  </p>
                  <div class="code-example">
                     <pre class="brush: js notranslate">
                             <code><span class="token keyword">const</span> heading <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>h1<span class="token operator">&gt;</span>Mozilla Developer Network<span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>h1<span class="token operator">&gt;</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
                           </code></pre>
                  </div>

                  <p class="text-justify">This heading constant is known as a <strong>JSX expression</strong>. React can
                     use it to render that
                     <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements"><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></a> tag in our app.
                     Suppose we wanted to wrap our heading in a <a
                        href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header"><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></a> tag, for semantic
                     reasons? The JSX approach allows us to nest our elements within each other, just like we do with
                     HTML:
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-justify">

                     <strong>Note:</strong> The parentheses in the previous snippet aren't unique to JSX, and don't have
                     any effect on your application. They're a signal to you (and your computer) that the multiple lines
                     of code inside are part of the same expression. You could just as well write the header expression
                     like this:
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">It's <em>possible</em> to skip the compilation step and use <a
                        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#createelement" class="external"
                        rel=" noopener"><code>React.createElement()</code></a> to write your UI yourself. In doing this,
                     however, you lose the declarative benefit of JSX, and your code becomes harder to read. Compilation
                     is
                     an extra step in the development process, but many developers in the React community think that the
                     readability of JSX is worthwhile. Plus, modern front-end development almost always involves a build
                     process anyway — you have to downlevel modern syntax to be compatible with older browsers, and you
                     may
                     want to <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/minification">minify</a> your code to optimize loading
                     performance. Popular tooling like Babel already comes with JSX support out-of-the-box, so you don't
                     have to configure compilation yourself unless you want to.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">Because JSX is a blend of HTML and JavaScript, some developers find it
                     intuitive. Others say that its
                     blended nature makes it confusing. Once you're comfortable with it, however, it will allow you to
                     build user interfaces more quickly and intuitively, and allow others to better understand your
                     codebase at a glance.</p>

                  <h3>Setting up your first React app</h3>
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">There are many ways to use React, but we're going to use the command-line
                     interface (CLI) tool
                     create-react-app, as mentioned earlier, which expedites the process of developing a React
                     application
                     by installing some packages and creating some files for you, handling the tooling described above.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-justify">It's possible to <a
                        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html" class="external" rel=" noopener">add
                        React to a website without create-react-app</a> by copying some <a
                        href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script"><code>&lt;script&gt;</code></a> elements into an HTML
                     file, but the create-react-app CLI is a common starting point for React applications. Using it will
                     allow you to spend more time building your app, and less time fussing with setup.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">In order to use create-react-app, you need to have <a
                        href="https://nodejs.org/en/" class="external" rel=" noopener">Node.js</a> installed. It's
                     recommended that you use the
                     long-term support (LTS)
                     version. Node includes npm (the node package manager), and npx (the node package runner).</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">You may also use the Yarn package manager as an alternative, but we'll assume
                     you are using npm in
                     this set of tutorials. See <a
                        href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Package_management">Package
                        management basics</a> for more information on npm and yarn.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">If you're using Windows, you will need to install some software to give you
                     parity with Unix/macOS
                     terminal in order to use the terminal commands mentioned in this tutorial. <strong>Gitbash</strong>
                     (which comes as part of the <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" class="external"
                        rel=" noopener">git

                           class="external" rel=" noopener">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a></strong>
                     (<strong>WSL</strong>)
                     are both suitable. See <a

                  <p class="text-justify">Also bear in mind that React and ReactDOM produce apps that only work on a
                     fairly modern set of
                     browsers — IE9+ by way of some polyfills. It is recommended that you use a modern browser like
                     Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, or Chrome when working through these tutorials.</p>

                  <h3>Initializing your app</h3>
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-justify">create-react-app takes one argument: the name you'd like to give your app.
                     create-react-app uses
                     this
                     name to make a new directory, then creates the necessary files inside it. Make sure you
                     <code>cd</code> to the place you'd like your app to live on your hard drive, then run the following
                     in
                     your terminal:
                  </p>
                  <pre class="brush: bash notranslate"><code>npx create-react-app moz-todo-react
                     </code></pre>
                  <p class="text-justify">This creates a <code>moz-todo-react</code> directory, and does several things
                     inside it:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Installs some npm packages essential to the functionality of the app.</li>
                     <li>Writes scripts for starting and serving the application.</li>
                     <li>Creates a structure of files and directories that define the basic app architecture.</li>
                     <li>Initializes the directory as a git repository, if you have git installed on your computer.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="text-justify"><strong>Note:</strong> if you have the Yarn package manager installed,
                     create-react-app will
                     default to using it instead of npm. If you have both package managers installed and explicitly want
                     to use npm, you can add the flag <code>--use-npm</code> when you run create-react-app:</p>

                  <pre class="brush: bash notranslate"><code>npx create-react-app moz-todo-react --use-npm
                  </code></pre>
                  <p class="text-justify">create-react-app will display a number of messages in your terminal while it
                     works; this is normal!
                     This might take a few minutes, so now might be a good time to go make a cup of tea.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">When the process is complete, <code>cd</code> into the
                     <code>moz-todo-react</code> directory and
                     run
                     the command <code>npm start</code>. The scripts installed by create-react-app will start being
                     served
                     at a local server at localhost:3000, and open the app in a new browser tab. Your browser will
                     display
                     something like this:</p>

                  <p class="text-justify">create-react-app gives us everything we need to develop a React application.
                     Its initial file

                     read by your browser
                     while you're developing the app; the most important of these is <code>index.html</code>. React
                     injects
                     your code into this file so that your browser can run it. There's some other markup that helps
                     create-react-app function, so take care not to edit it unless you know what you're doing. You very
                     much should change the text inside the <a

                  <p class="text-justify">In React, a <strong>component</strong> is a reusable module that renders a
                     part of our app. These

                     <p class="text-justify">Note that we don't write a path or extension when importing the
                        <code>React</code> module — this is
                        not a local file; instead, it is listed as a dependency in our <code>package.json</code> file.
                        Be
                        careful of this distinction as you work through this lesson!</p>
                     <p class="text-justify">The second statement imports a logo from <code>'./logo.svg'</code>. Note
                        the use of <code>./</code>
                        at the beginning of the path, and the <code>.svg</code> extension at the end — these tell us
                        that the
                        file is local and that it is not a JavaScript file. Indeed, the <code>logo.svg</code> file lives
                        in
                        our source directory.</p>
                     <p class="text-justify">The third statement imports the CSS related to our App component. Note that
                        there is no variable name
                        and no <code>from</code> directive. This is called a <em>side-effect import</em> — it doesn't
                        import
                        any value into the JavaScript file, but it tells Webpack, the bundler, to add the referenced CSS
                        file
                        to the final CSS bundle.</p>

                  <h3>
                     The App component
                  </h3>
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-justify">After the imports, we have a function named <code>App</code>. Whereas most of
                     the JavaScript
                     community prefers camel-case names like <code>helloWorld</code>, React components use pascal-case
                     variable names, like <code>HelloWorld</code>, to make it clear that a given JSX element is a React
                     component, and not a regular HTML tag. If you were to rename the <code>App</code> function to
                     <code>app</code>, your browser would show you an error.

                  <p class="text-justify">The <code>App</code> function returns a JSX expression. This expression
                     defines what your browser
                     ultimately renders to the DOM.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">Some elements in the expression have attributes, which are written just like
                     in HTML, following a
                     pattern of <code>attribute="value"</code>. On line 3, the opening <a
                        href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a> tag has a
                     <code>className</code> attribute. This is the same as the <a
                        href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class"><code>class</code></a> attribute in HTML,
                     but
                     because JSX is JavaScript, we can't use the word <code>class</code> — it's reserved, meaning
                     JavaScript already uses it for a specific purpose and it would cause problems here in our code. A
                     few
                     other HTML attributes are written differently in JSX than they are in HTML too, for the same kind
                     of
                     reason. We'll cover them as we encounter them.

                     which are a way of passing data into a component (which can then be accessed using variables).</p>

                  <p class="text-justify">When you save, your browser should display "Hello, React!" instead of "Hello,
                     world!"</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">Variables are convenient, but the one we've just set doesn't make great use of
                     React's features.
                     That's where props come in.</p>

                  <p>
                  <h3>Component props</h3>
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-justify">A <strong>prop</strong> is any data passed into a React component. React props
                     are comparable to HTML
                     attributes. Where HTML elements have attributes, React components have props. Props are written
                     inside
                     component calls, and use the same syntax as HTML attributes — <code>prop="value"</code>. In React,
                     dataflow is unidirectional: props can only be passed from Parent components down to Child
                     components;
                     and props are read-only.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">Let's open <code>index.js</code> and give our <code>&lt;App/&gt;</code> call
                     its first prop.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">Add a prop of <code>subject</code> to the <code>&lt;App/&gt;</code> component
                     call, with a value of
                     <code>Clarice</code>. When you are done, your code should look something like this:
                  </p>

                  <pre class="brush: js notranslate"><code>root<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">render</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token operator">&lt;</span>App subject<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"Clarice"</span> <span class="token operator">/</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
                   </code></pre>
                  <p class="text-justify">Back in <code>App.js</code>, let's revisit the App function itself, which
                     reads like this (with the
                     <code>return</code> statement shortened for brevity):
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                     Change the signature of the <code>App</code> function so that it accepts <code>props</code> as a
                     parameter, and delete the <code>subject</code> const.
                     Just like any other function parameter, you can put <code>props</code> in a
                     <code>console.log()</code>
                     to print it to your browser's console. Go ahead and do that before the <code>return</code>
                     statement,
                     like so:
                  </p>
                  <pre class="brush: js notranslate"><code><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">App</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">props</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

                     <span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
                   <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
                   </code></pre>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                     With this change, {subject} becomes undefined, so comment out the line
                     <code>Hello, {subject}!</code>
                     for now.
                     Save your file and check your browser's JavaScript console. You should see something like this
                     logged:
                  </p>
                  <pre class="notranslate">Object { subject: "Clarice" }
   </pre>
                  <p class="text-justify">The object property <code>subject</code> corresponds to the
                     <code>subject</code> prop we added to our
                     <code>&lt;App /&gt;</code> component call, and the string <code>Clarice</code> corresponds to its
                     value. Component props in React are always collected into objects in this fashion.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-justify">Now that <code>subject</code> is one of our props, let's utilize it in
                     <code>App.js</code>. Change
                     the <code>subject</code> constant so that, instead of defining it as the string <code>React</code>,
                     you are reading the value of <code>props.subject</code>. Now, you can also uncomment the line
                     <code>Hello, {subject}!</code> and, if you wish, delete your <code>console.log()</code>.

                  <p class="text-justify">
                     When you save, the app should now greet you with "Hello, Clarice!". If you return to
                     <code>index.js</code>, edit the value of <code>subject</code>, and save, your text will change.
                     Note that if you wanted to leave in the <code>Hello</code> line throughout this change, you could
                     also
                     have updated the JSX variable to {props.subject}.

                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">This brings us to the end of our initial look at React, including how to
                     install it locally, creating
                     a starter app, and how the basics work. In the next article, we'll start building our first proper
                     application — a todo list. Before we do that, however, let's recap some of the things we've
                     learned.
                  </p>
                  <p>In React:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Components can import modules they need and must export themselves at the bottom of their
                        files.
                     </li>
                     <li>Component functions are named with <code>PascalCase</code>.</li>
                     <li>You can read JSX variables by putting them between curly braces, like <code>{so}</code>.</li>
                     <li>Some JSX attributes are different than HTML attributes so that they don't conflict with
                        JavaScript
                        reserved words. For example, <code>class</code> in HTML translates to <code>className</code> in
                        JSX.
                        Note that multi-word attributes are in <code>camelCase</code>.</li>
                     <li>Props are written just like attributes inside component calls and are passed into components.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
